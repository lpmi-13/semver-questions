        Hi there! Semantic versioning uses three numbers with dots in the middle to show what happened in an update.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first number means the MAJOR version, and changing this usually means you can't use the dependency in the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
        The second number means the MINOR version, and changing this usually means you can use it in a new way, but the old way still works fine. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The third number means the PATCH version, and changing this means bugs were fixed, but everything else should still work the same.
        </p>
        <p>
